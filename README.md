# Project1
This documentation should contain understanding of the problem and your problem-solving approach, description of methods and variables used. This file will be reviewed by an instructor along with the codes during code review.
1. Objective:
The objective of this programming project is to implement a Java program which can read a file, parse data, perform some calculation on data, and some basics on Date/Time. After completing the project, students will have an intermediate understanding of reading data from a file and performing some calculation on data and basics of Date/Time function in Java.
2. ProjectSpecification:
2.1. Overall Program Behavior:
In this project you have to perform some operations on Date/Time and String which will be extended in the later projects in this semester. You are also required to read the file provided, Mesonet.txt. You will require some edit/modification on data to get the station ID(s) (STID: four letter code). There are more than 100 stations, therefore try to declare an array with a small size and expand the array whenever needed.
We provided Driver.java and Mesonet.txt [Pls, don’t edit these two files]. We also provided DateTimeOne.java, which is incomplete, you have to complete it. you are required to write DateTimeOne.java, HammingDist.java and README.md.

We are providing: Driver.java, Mesonet.txt (Don’t modify these two files) We are providing but you will add code: DateTimeOne.java
You will write: HammingDist.java and README.md

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
